      <h1> Average Distance Traveled </h1>
      <p> I calculated average distanced traveled by estimating that the average person rides a bike 
          at a pace of 15km/hr and then converting that into 4.2 m/s and multiplying it by the duration
        of a ride and finding the mean of all trips </p>

      <h1> Commuter Data: </h1>
      <p> I estimated that the number of commuters was around 494 people.
         I got this number by taking the data of the number of trips everyday. 
         If a person was commuting to work they will most likely do this on a daily basis.
         Thus, the average number of trips will give you the closest number to the number of
         commuters since the average gives you the average trips done everyday and a commuter 
        would on average do one trip everyday because they would have to go to work daily. </p>

      <h1> Season Data: </h1>
      <p> I graphed all the trips on a bar graph with the y axis being the number of trips done in that specific month.
          By doing this, I discovered that late summer, early fall (08-10) were the most popular season with a peak
          on August. After August, there is a strong decrease in trips for the winter season (12 - 03). </p>

      <h1> Trip Route Category-Passholder Data: </h1>
      <p> From the table it is clear that the most popular combination by a huge 
          margin were Walk-up, One-Way and Montly Pass, One-way. One way is much more popular then roundtrips.
          One way-Monthly is by far the most popular for people commuting to and from work because they must park their bike
          to work and then get another bike to go home every day. Furthermore,
          montly users would be more inclined to use the bikes because they had already paid for it. In addition,
          for typical users if they wanted to get from one destination to another with the bike they would more 
          often then not simply be going one-way which explains why Walk Up - One way combination was so popular.
          The way people were using the bike would make one combination much more popular then the other. Since 
          people were using one-way more then the roundtrip, we can assume that people were using the bike share as
          a way to get around LA. If they weren't trying to get around the City then roundtrip would be much more 
          popular since that would indicate people were not trying to get to any destination with the bikes and were
        using it to exercise or recreational use. </p>
